This project document the behind the scenes for my renders and is an excuse to have something to post while I learn html 5, css 3 and js.
Also serves to document the learning process of 3d graphics, geometry nodes in blender 3d and Adobe After Effects.
I am the sole person who maintain and contribute to this project.
